# Customer App

Customer App is my first project on my way to learning and mastering the MEAN stack.

## Core Technologies:

- Node.js at the core of the app.
- Express as the web framework to handle the backend.
- Mongodb as the database where all the information will be stored.
- Angular2 as the frontend framework to give a vibe to the app.

## Node Modules

_*EJS*_
_*Body Parser*_
_*Express Validator*_
_*Mongoose*_
